    When anyone under the age of 18 is either being harmed or not properly looked after, the crime is considered as Child Abuse. The categories of child abuse include physical, emotional, sexual abuse and child neglect. If you suspect a child is suffering from abuse, you can reach out to Women Safety Wing for action, counselling, redressal and rehabilitation.

   <p class="par2">POCSO or the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) 2012 was enacted to protect children against offences like sexual abuse, sexual harassment and pornography while safe guarding their interests at every stage of the judicial process. This is done through incorporating child friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated courts. Section 19 of the Act casts a duty on the police officer to promptly record a complaint made under the Act. </p>
