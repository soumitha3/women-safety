   <p class="par1">Acts & Laws for Harassment in Public Places</p>
   <p class="par2">Many laws were enacted to curb domestic violence beginning with Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 which made the act of giving and receiving dowry a crime. To further strengthen this law two new sections section 498 A and section 304 B were introduced into the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in 1983 and 1986. The most recent law is the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) 2005, a civil Law which broadened the definition of domestic violence to include physical, emotional, sexual, verbal and economic violence as we know it today. Other Acts include The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987, Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, etc.</p>
