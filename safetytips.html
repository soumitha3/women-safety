  <h1>SAFETY TIPS</h1>
  <hr>
  <p class="par2">
  Stay alert and conscious of your surroundings. Avoid using headphones or being engrossed in your phone while walking in unfamiliar areas.
  <br><br>
Trust your instincts. If something feels off or uncomfortable, take action accordingly. It's okay to say no and remove yourself from a situation that doesn't feel safe.
<br><br>
Inform someone you trust about your plans, especially if you're going out alone. Use location-sharing features on your phone with trusted friends or family.
<br><br>
Taking self-defense classes can boost your confidence and provide valuable skills. Consider carrying personal safety devices like pepper spray or a personal alarm if legal and permitted.
<br><br>
Stick to well-lit streets and populated areas, especially at night. Avoid shortcuts through dark alleys or isolated areas.
<br><br>
Keep your belongings secure and be mindful of your purse, phone, and other valuables. Avoid displaying expensive jewelry or items that might attract unwanted attention.
<br><br>
Travel with friends or in groups whenever possible. There is safety in numbers, and potential attackers may be deterred by a group.
<br><br>
Opt for reputable transportation services, and share your ride details with someone you trust. Check the driver's details and ensure they match the information in the app.
<br><br>
Keep an eye on your drink at all times to prevent tampering. Don't accept drinks from strangers unless you witness them being prepared.
<br><br>
Save emergency contacts in your phone and know how to quickly dial emergency services. Familiarize yourself with local emergency numbers and services.
<br><br>
Be cautious about sharing personal information online. Adjust privacy settings on social media and be mindful of location tagging.<br><br>

Stay informed about safety resources and organizations in your community. Attend workshops or seminars on personal safety.</p>
